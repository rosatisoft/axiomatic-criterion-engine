## Manifesto Abstract
## Axiomatic Ontological Discernment

Intelligence without discernment accelerates entropy.

Modern AI systems do not fail because they lack data, scale, or sophistication. They fail because they lack a foundation for judgment. Probability can predict patterns, but it cannot distinguish truth from illusion, meaning from noise, or fiction from hallucination. At scale, this limitation is not benign—it is structural.

The Axiomatic Criterion Engine (ACE) asserts a simple but radical claim:
intelligence must be grounded before it is generated.

Discernment is not moderation.
Discernment is not censorship.
Discernment is not alignment by preference.

Discernment is the capacity to recognize what is, what is not, and under which context meaning is valid.

By restoring an ontological order—Truth → Identity → Existence—ACE introduces a deterministic layer that precedes probability, not one that corrects it after the fact. This restores coherence without suppressing creativity, allowing fiction to exist as fiction, art as art, and reality as reality—without collapse.

The result is not constraint, but clarity.
Not control, but integrity.
Not less intelligence, but intelligence that knows where it stands.

In an era where ambiguity is weaponized and hallucination scales faster than understanding, discernment is no longer optional. It is the condition for survival—epistemic, cultural, and technological.

ACE does not teach machines what to think.
It teaches systems when thinking is justified.

This is not an improvement to artificial intelligence.
It is the restoration of judgment.
