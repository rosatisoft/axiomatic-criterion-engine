Current large language model architectures are fundamentally probabilistic systems optimized for linguistic continuity rather than epistemic validity. While effective at scale, this paradigm incurs three structural costs: escalating computational waste, semantic instability under ambiguity, and the inability to distinguish reality, fiction, and manipulation at the architectural level. Existing safety and alignment mechanisms operate downstream, after probabilistic inference has already occurred.

This work introduces Axiomatic Ontological Discernment, implemented through the Axiomatic Criterion Engine (ACE), as a deterministic pre-inference layer designed to address these limitations at their root. ACE is not a content filter, policy engine, or moderation heuristic. It is an architectural organ of judgment that evaluates inputs according to ontological coherence, contextual validity, and evidential grounding before probabilistic generation is invoked.

By grounding discernment in The Axiom of the Absolute, ACE establishes a minimal but non-negotiable criterion:

where evidence is present, doubt is unnecessary;

where evidence is absent, misinterpretation becomes entropic;

where context is explicit, meaning is preserved;

where context collapses, hallucination emerges.

Empirical implementation within production pipelines demonstrates that this approach:

reduces token expenditure by up to 70–90% on entropic or low-value inputs,

prevents hallucination without suppressing creativity,

enables explicit separation between objective reality, fictional domains, symbolic language, and speculative reasoning,

scales across models without reliance on model size, training data, or alignment fine-tuning.

A central case study demonstrates ACE’s capacity to validate fictional and artistic narratives as meaningful without misclassifying them as factual claims, thereby rescuing imagination from hallucination rather than constraining it. This resolves a core failure mode of probabilistic systems: category collapse under ambiguity.

From an architectural perspective, ACE repositions large language models from autonomous decision simulators into judgment-assisted reasoning systems. Probabilistic inference remains valuable—but only once ontological integrity has been established. This separation enables labs to redirect computation toward high-value reasoning, simulation, and synthesis, while reducing downstream safety complexity.

The implication is direct: scalable intelligence without ontological discernment amplifies entropy. ACE proposes a path where efficiency, safety, creativity, and truth are no longer competing objectives, but consequences of correct architectural ordering.

Axiomatic discernment is not an optional safeguard. It is the missing prerequisite for coherent intelligence at scale.
