# Contributing to the Axiomatic Criterion Engine (ACE)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Axiomatic Criterion Engine (ACE)**.

ACE is not a conventional software project.  
It is a **deterministic layer of ontological discernment** designed to precede probabilistic intelligence.  
As such, contributions are evaluated not only for technical quality, but for **epistemic integrity**.

This document defines **how to contribute**, **what kind of contributions are welcome**, and **what this project explicitly does not accept**.

---

## 1. Purpose of Contributions

The purpose of contributions to ACE is to **strengthen its capacity to respect the structure of reality**.

ACE exists to:
- Discern **Truth vs. Entropy**
- Separate **Reality from Hallucination**
- Prevent **sophistic reasoning** from entering inference pipelines
- Preserve human and machine intelligence from epistemic degradation

Efficiency, performance, and cost reduction are **secondary effects** of this discipline — not its goal.

Any contribution that weakens this hierarchy will not be accepted.

---

## 2. Ontological Integrity Rules (Non-Negotiable)

All contributions must comply with the following principles:

### 2.1 Discernment Precedes Intelligence
ACE evaluates **whether an inference path is valid** before intelligence is applied.

- Do **not** add logic that optimizes or embellishes invalid inputs
- Do **not** soften ontological violations for user satisfaction
- Do **not** replace discernment with probability, sentiment, or popularity

### 2.2 No Relativism
ACE does **not** accept:
- “Multiple truths”
- Outcome-based redefinitions of truth
- Emotion as a substitute for evidence
- Cultural consensus as ontological authority

Truth is not negotiated.

### 2.3 No Censorship
ACE is **not** a moderation tool.

- It does not silence ideas
- It does not enforce ideology
- It does not judge morality by preference

It **discerns coherence**.  
Invalid inference paths are rejected because they are **ontologically inconsistent**, not because they are uncomfortable.

### 2.4 Fiction Is a Domain, Not an Exception
ACE explicitly supports **fiction, art, metaphor, and imagination**.

- Fiction must be declared or inferred as a **contextual domain**
- Fiction is valid **within its domain**
- Fiction must never be promoted as empirical reality

ACE rejects hallucination — not imagination.

## 3. Types of Contributions We Welcome

### 3.1 Technical Contributions
You may contribute to:
- Deterministic middleware optimization
- Integration with LLM frameworks (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
- Latency reduction (<5ms target for Stage I)
- Memory safety and reproducibility
- SDK design and API clarity

All technical changes must preserve **deterministic judgment**.

---

### 3.2 Ontological Contributions
You may contribute to:
- Formalization of new **Contextual Domains**
  - Scientific
  - Legal
  - Historical
  - Fictional / Artistic
- Refinement of the deductive pipeline
- Clarification of Truth–Identity–Existence relationships

Ontological contributions must:
- Be explicit
- Be testable
- Avoid ambiguity-by-design

---

### 3.3 Empirical Contributions (Edge Cases)
We strongly encourage contributors to document:
- Sophisms
- Manipulative prompts
- Gaslighting patterns
- Conspiracy constructions
- Relativistic traps
- Creative edge cases (fiction vs hallucination)

These cases are essential to refining **Stage I: Entropy Detection**.

---

## 4. How to Propose a New Edge Case

Create a Markdown file under:

```

/docs/edge-cases/

````

Each file must include:

```md
## Case Description
(Describe the input and why it is epistemically relevant)

## Input
(The exact text submitted to ACE)

## Detected Domain
(e.g. Objective Reality, Fiction, Moral Reasoning, Scientific Claim)

## Entropy Indicators
- What makes this input entropic?
- What ontological rule is violated (if any)?

## Expected ACE Decision
(REJECT / ORIENT / ACCEPT)

## Rationale
(Explain the deduction step-by-step using the ACE hierarchy)
````

Edge cases without clear ontological rationale will not be accepted.

---

## 5. What We Do NOT Accept

The following will be rejected without exception:

* Prompt engineering designed to bypass discernment
* Probabilistic fallbacks for ontological violations
* “Both sides” logic applied to objective claims
* Emotional framing used to justify invalid inference
* Contributions that treat ACE as a chatbot or opinion engine
* Any attempt to dilute the Axiom of the Absolute

---

## 6. Governance and Review

All contributions are reviewed under:

* `GOVERNANCE.md`
* `ACE_PRINCIPLES.md`
* `THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK.md`

Acceptance is based on **coherence**, not consensus.

---

## 7. Final Note

ACE is not built to be popular.
It is built to be **correct**.

If your contribution strengthens discernment, it will be welcomed.
If it introduces ambiguity, relativism, or epistemic shortcuts, it will be rejected.

This is intentional.

> **ACE is not a tool for censorship, but an architect of sense.**

Thank you for contributing responsibly.
